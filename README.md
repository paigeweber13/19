# 19
A platformer game created for Grump Jam 2019.

# Todo
 * [x] create person who can be controlled to jump and move
 * [x] create platforms and pits
 * [x] add jump/fall animations
 * [ ] finish levels:
     * [ ] lateral part with pit that stops you
     * [ ] "I can't.... " text
     * [x] vertical part climbing to the outside
 * [ ] sounds
 * [ ] "you were killed" screen
     * [ ] this will also give player time to fall if checkpoint is in mid air
           don't make the screen a new scene, just cover up the current one?
